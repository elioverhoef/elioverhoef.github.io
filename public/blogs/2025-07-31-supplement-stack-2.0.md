### **From User to Architect**

Two years ago, I shared my initial supplement stack. It was the beginning of a journey. Today, as the CTO of LongevAI and a dedicated endurance athlete, that journey has evolved into a systematic process of self-optimization. I don't just *take* supplements; I architect a protocol designed to fuel every facet of my life—from deep work coding sprints to demanding athletic goals.

This is my 2025 blueprint. It's a dynamic system, built on blood tests, performance data, and rigorous self-experimentation. It's what fuels my energy, sharpens my mind, and fortifies my long-term health.

> ⚠️ **A Crucial Disclaimer: You Are Not Me.**
> This is my personal protocol, the result of my own N=1 experimentation. It is not medical advice. I am sharing my process to inspire your own journey of discovery. **Do your own research.** Consult with healthcare professionals. Use resources like [Examine.com](https://examine.com/). Your biology is unique; your supplement stack should be too.

## **🧬 The Core Philosophy: Systems Over Stacks**

My approach rests on three pillars:
1.  **Cover the Foundations:** Ensure core nutrient levels (like Vitamin D, Omega-3, Magnesium) are optimal before adding anything else.
2.  **Enhance Performance:** Strategically add compounds to support specific goals (cognitive function, physical output, stress resilience).
3.  **Explore the Frontier:** Cautiously experiment with novel compounds that show promise for long-term health and longevity.

Let's dive into the blueprint.

## **🌅 The Morning Ritual: Foundation & Fuel**

This stack is taken upon waking to set the baseline for the day.

| Supplement | Dosage | Why I Take It: The Architect's Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Omega-3** (High EPA) | ~3g | **Brain Architecture & Anti-inflammation.** Essential for cognitive function and managing inflammation from intense training. |
| **Vitamin D3 + K2** | 2000 IU (D3) | **Hormonal & Immune Baseline.** Crucial for everything from mood to immune defense. K2 ensures calcium is deposited in bones, not arteries. |
| **Creatine Monohydrate** | 5g | **Dual-Fuel for Muscle & Mind.** A powerhouse for physical power output and, just as importantly, for cognitive energy during deep work. |
| **Collagen Powder** | 10-20g | **Connective Tissue Support.** Drinking it with water to support the health of my skin. |
| **Coenzyme Q10** | 100mg | **Mitochondrial Powerhouse.** I need more as per my DNA test, so I supplement. |
| **Ashwagandha KSM-66** | ~600mg | **Stress Modulation.** Acts as a buffer against cortisol, helping me maintain clarity during heavy workdays. |
| **Taurine** | 1g | **Nervous System Stability & Hydration.** Supports cardiovascular health and electrolyte balance, which is critical for my endurance training. |
| **NAC** (N-acetylcysteine) | 600-700mg | **Master Antioxidant & Detox.** Supports glutathione production and helps clear mental fog. A key part of my "mental hygiene" protocol. |
| **Astaxanthin** | 4-12mg | **Potent Cellular Protector.** A powerful antioxidant, particularly for mitigating cellular stress from exercise and supporting skin and eye health. |
| **Hyaluronic Acid** | 100mg | **Joint Health & Hydration.** Supports joint lubrication and skin hydration from within, a key component of my recovery protocol. |

## **🧠 The Afternoon Edge: Focus & Performance**

This stack is deployed strategically for cognitive sprints or pre-workout.

| Supplement | Dosage | Why I Take It: The Architect's Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha-GPC** | 300-600mg | **The "Deep Work" Catalyst.** My go-to for intense focus. It boosts acetylcholine, a key neurotransmitter for learning and memory. Taken 30-45 mins before a coding block or critical meeting. |
| **Pure Brainpower** | 1 capsule | **BDNF Support.** Contains coffee fruit extract to support Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor, which helps grow new neurons. Excellent for neuroplasticity and learning. |
| **Electrolyte Concentrate - 40000 Volts**| Per instructions| **Hydration for Performance.** Added to my water bottle before a run or during a long workday to maintain optimal mineral balance and prevent dehydration-induced fatigue. |

## **🌙 The Evening Protocol: Recovery & Recharge**

This stack is taken 1-2 hours before bed to facilitate deep, restorative sleep.

| Supplement | Dosage | Why I Take It: The Architect's Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Magnesium Glycinate** | ~400mg | **Nervous System Deceleration.** The glycinate form is excellent for promoting calm and relaxation. It quiets the mind after a stimulating day. |
| **L-Theanine** | 200mg | **"Wakeful Relaxation."** Works synergistically with Magnesium to reduce anxiety and mental chatter without causing drowsiness. It helps me transition into a restful state. |
| **Apigenin** | 50mg | **Sleep Quality Enhancer.** A bioflavonoid found in chamomile that helps reduce anxiety and has been shown to improve sleep quality. |
| **Glycine** | 5g | **Lowers Core Body Temperature.** This is a powerful, yet simple mechanism to improve sleep latency (how fast you fall asleep) and sleep quality. |
| **Boron** | 3mg | **SHBG Regulation.** My bloodwork and nut-rich diet show elevated SHBG (Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin). I take boron to help manage these levels. |
| **Melatonin** (Low Dose) | 0.5-3mg | **The Hormonal Nudge.** To fall asleep faster and sleep better. **This is a hormone, not a vitamin; use with caution and respect.** |

## **🔬 The Biohacker's Toolkit: Cyclical & Specific Use**

These are compounds I use cyclically or for a specific purpose, rather than daily.

*   **Lithium Orotate (5mg):** I'm currently exploring this for its potential neuroprotective and mood-stabilizing effects at microdoses.
*   **Ginger Root:** A powerful natural anti-inflammatory with a long history of use in traditional medicine.

### **The Journey Continues**

This blueprint is a snapshot in time. It will continue to evolve as new research emerges and as my own goals shift. The core principle remains the same: holding myself to a higher standard of well-being, energy management, and clarity.

My ultimate goal is not just to live longer, but to live *better*—with more energy, more joy, and a greater capacity to create and contribute. This protocol is simply one of the systems I've built to make that vision a reality.

What does your blueprint look like? What have you found works for you?

Happy biohacking!
