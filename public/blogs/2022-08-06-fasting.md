Hi! I’m Elio and I will explain what fasting can do for you and how to apply it to your life.

We’ll be looking into three topics:

- What is fasting?
- Why should you fast?
- Some practical tips to implement fasting into your life

## What is fasting?

Fasting is not eating or taking in any calories for a certain number of hours. Water, tea, or coffee is fine, but avoid other drinks that contain calories.

First, you will use up the sugar in your blood.

Then, your body will start using stored glycogen in muscles to produce glucose.

After this, your body will start burning fat to create glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis and to create ketones in the liver. Your body can then use these ketones as an alternative energy source.

## Why should you fast?

Because fasting has LOTS of benefits. I will describe them by dividing these scientifically supported arguments in 4 categories: health & longevity, disease prevention & recovery, cognitive performance, and finally practical advantages.

### Health & longevity

Improves cardiovascular health based on 3 findings of the effects of fasting:

- stronger left ventricle [pump blood body] [2]
- improved flow-mediated vasodilation (how much arteries widen after flow restriction) [2]
  This is an excellent predictor of long-term cardiovascular health
- lower resting heartrate & blood pressure [2]

Fasting reduces insulin resistance [1]. This is the consequence of lower insulin in your body throughout the day.

**Explanation**: insulin resistance is how well you can process glucose. Normally when you eat carbs, insulin is produced, allowing cells to take glucose and use it as fuel. When insulin resistance is present, this function is severely hampered, causing an overflow of sugar in your blood.

Fasting reduces inflammation [2].

Fasting stimulates production of growth hormone — causing more growth, muscle strength, and an effective metabolism [2].

Fasting for about 3 days or more causes the production of certain proteins: mTOR, AMPK, and sirtuins [9].

AMPK, mTOR and sirtuins allow for autophagy. Cells use their internal waste such as damaged proteins to produce useful stuff; they recycle parts of themselves.

These proteins can actually restore the epigenome.

The epigenome is the way in which the DNA is folded in each cell, defining the type and the characteristics of that cell. Over time, this epigenome can get damaged by environmental factors. I have not been able to find out how this happens exactly, as it’s a quite complex process.

Burning fat [1] and reducing blood glucose are other consequences of fasting [2]. As you burn fat, your body can more easily burn fat in the future, you become what’s called ‘fat-adapted’.

Fasting lowers LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol [2].

### Disease prevention and recovery

Next to all these health benefits, fasting also reduces the likelihood of a LOT of common diseases:
Alzheimer’s disease, cancer, diabetes, parkinson’s disease, respiratory diseases, therosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, and renal diseases [2].

### Cognitive performance

Increase in neurotrophic factors (FNF and BDNF) leads to neurogenesis, more brain cell generation! This, in turn, causes better memory & brain function [2].

#### Steady energy [2]

This is not necessarily experienced during fasting, especially when your body is not yet well adapted to using ketones as fuel, but after fasting your energy levels will be more steady due to the increased stability of glucose levels.

This stability is a consequence of the increased insulin sensitivity, where your body gets rid of excess glucose more easily, leaving you with higher glucose dips.

### Practical advantages

Free time for other things, no more breaks just to eat.

Losing weight by burning fat.

**Potential benefits:**

- Happiness — supported by Ramadan fasting [10]. This effect could also have been the consequence of the increased social connection or any other part of ramadan fasting that is not fasting itself.
  However, I can say that fasting definitely contributed to my own happiness, where some days where I’m fasting I feel simply incredible.
  Of course, this could also be due to other factors, but I feel like fasting certainly plays a role.
- Decrease in stress — lower anxiety & depression levels [8].

### Why shouldn’t you fast?

Fasting can cause fatigue, headaches, nausea, and cravings [11, 12].

These problems should disappear with time, but by easing yourself into fasting, you can make the transition more pleasant.

Fasting causes decreased athletic performance, especially for anaerobic exercise.

## Practical tips

Use apps that keep track of your fasting session.

- Fasting tracker (also has a water tracker)
- Zero (Lots of useful info at their blog. They also have a quiz that makes you reflect on your choices!)

Drink enough water & take minerals: 2–4g salt/day or about a teaspoon per day [4], 400–600mg magnesium/day [3], and 2–5g potassium/ day [13]. This is especially important for extended, multiple day fasts.

Salt is essential for controlling the water levels in cells, passing on nerve signals and maintaining an acid-base balance. If salt levels become too low, this can even become dangerous!

As your body has less salt, the osmolarity outside of your cells drops. This causes the water to move from this extracellular space into your cells, making them swell and eventually burst or die. If you feel tired, nauseous, or generally bad, you may have not had enough salt.

When going longer than 5 days, I recommend to seek special advice for what supplements you might need.

Start easy by fasting just a bit longer than you normally fast each day. From there, slowly work your way up towards longer intermittent fasting when you feel ready. For example, start with 16 hours/day, and slowly work your way up to 20 hours/day.

Once your body has been accomodated to using fat as fuel through intermittent fasting, you can try fasting for multiple days, as this is where the greater benefits of fasting like autophagy come into play.

Also find what works for you — how can you easily incomporate fasting into your schedule?

Good luck!
