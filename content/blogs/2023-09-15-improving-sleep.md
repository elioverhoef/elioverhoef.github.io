## Introduction

Hi, I’m Elio, and I will try to help you sleep better.

People who have bad sleep not only live shorter [1] , they will have less energy during the day [2].

I will discuss 16 practical tips for improving your sleep, based on science. I will also discuss which of these I’ve implemented myself, and to what degree that has helped my sleep.

It’s quite a very large list, so it would be unreasonable to try everything at once.

It might be better to identify one of these factors that could be having the greatest impact on your sleep, and then focus on implementing just that one thing before implementing another one.

## Basic tips for improving sleep

1. View sunlight directly after wakeup
   1. Sets the circadian clock, such that you become sleepy in the late afternoon and evening!
      1. The earlier you view morning sunlight, the more you shift your circadian rhythm forwards, causing an earlier release of melatonin. [3]
   2. I got this from the one person who is known specifically for this advice - [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDv4AWk0J3U)
2. Limit ANY light close to bedtime, specifically blue light
   1. Blue light limits the production of melatonin, the hormone making you sleepy [4]
   2. Also try to keep the room dark during the night. The light receptors disrupting melatonin production get to work very quickly, so even if you use a flashlight for only a second or two, it can have negative effects on sleep.
3. Keep your environment cool: 18 Celsius or 65 Fahrenheit
   1. Based on general recommendations [5]. A cool environment is especially important for falling asleep.
      If this is not an option, maybe use a fan or only use the blanket sheet - the thin cloth you put around the blanket.
4. Do not take in caffeine in the first 90 minutes of being awake.
   1. That would spike your cortisol even higher in the morning, causing adverse effects to the circadian rhythm
   2. Couldn’t find study, yet another thing I took from Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. You can watch his entire podcast on caffeine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c
5. Stop taking any caffeine (coffee, tea) 12 hours before going to sleep.
   1. Half-life caffeine = 5 hours, but even slight amounts of caffeine have a noticeable negative effect on sleep. [6]
   2. The earlier you stop drinking, the better.
6. Do not drink alcohol close to bed
   1. Greatly harms sleep quality, so it’s best to not take it at all. I’ve heard this from people who drink alcohol and have sleep trackers: This is one of the, if not the greatest source of bad sleep.
      1. Science also supports this: **Source**
      2. If you do take alcohol, try to not take it close to bed. A guideline I found online says not to take it within 4 hours of sleeping [7].
7. Do not eat anything in the 3 hours preceding sleep. [8]
8. Limit fluid intake in the 3 hours (or more) before sleep if having to pee is waking you up at night.
   1. Drinking very slowly, or sipping the water instead of taking big gulps, also helps with this. When you would drink a lot of water at once, your body’s immediate reaction is to get rid of the water in order to keep total blood volume down. [9]
9. Get a good mattress
10. Take a hot shower or bath
    1. External heating cools down the body afterwards, allowing for improved sleep
    2. The relaxation also helps with falling asleep [10]
11. Limited sounds
    1. Sounds can keep you up, or wake you up
    2. If you live in a noisy environment, consider using white noise to drown out the background noise, as well as earplugs.

## Advanced improvements

1. Get a temperature controlled mattress - quite expensive [11]
2. Setup a wake-up light
   1. Using the Idinio app, I can controll the E23 light bulb that only costs 13 euro
      1. https://www.123led.nl/Idinio-Smart-wifi-lamp-E27-Idinio-9W-RGB-2700K-6500K-i7550-t3889.html
3. Very consistent sleep timing
   1. Go to sleep at roughly same time, differing a maximum of 30 minutes between days. [12]
4. Prevent alarms: They can cut your sleep during REM and deep sleep stages. [13]
5. Supplements [Highly optional]: **Magnesium threonate** [145mg], **l-theanine** [100-400mg], and **apigenin** [50mg]
   1. All of these reduce anxiety and promote relaxation to fall asleep faster.
   2. Apigenin is actually found in high dosages in chamomile tea, causing its relaxing effects
   3. Once again, I got these supplement recommendations from Andrew Huberman.

## What I’ve done

1. As you might know, I don’t drink alcohol
2. Wakeup light & No alarm
3. I go for a walk outside to view sunlight when directly after I wake up
4. No exercise in the second half of the day
5. If I take caffeine, before 12:00
6. I don’t eat in the late afternoon/evening, see my video on this: “Eat early, sleep better”
   1. This has greatly improved the quality of my sleep
7. No water 5 hours before sleep
   1. Less waking up at night (although still happens sometimes, don’t know why)
8. I limit any light in the evening, and use my automatic lamp to emit dim, purely red light
9. No devices 1 hour before sleep
10. A bit of reading
11. I sometimes take a warm shower before sleep
    1. This helps a lot! Being relaxed makes it so much easier to fall asleep.
12. Moderately consistent sleep timing
13. Occasionally using a fan when it’s hot - these days it’s 31 or 32 degrees during the day - in September in the Netherlands!
