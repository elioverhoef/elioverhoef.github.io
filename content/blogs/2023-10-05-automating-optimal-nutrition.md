As someone who values health and efficiency, I recently discovered a tool called Cronometer that has revolutionized the way I approach my nutrition. Cronometer allows users to easily plan and track their food intake based on extensive databases of various foods. Inspired by this, my brother and I set out to design an "optimal" meal plan for the week, focusing on balanced macronutrients, micronutrients, variety, and ease of preparation.

## Automating the Process

To streamline our weekly nutrition plan, we began using an automated delivery service from a nearby supermarket. By creating a premade list of all the necessary items, we can simply add them to our order and have them delivered once a week. This automation saves us valuable time and ensures that we always have the ingredients we need to stick to our plan.

## Benefits of Automated Meal Planning

1. **Continuous Improvement:** By consistently eating a healthy, well-balanced diet, we can monitor how our bodies respond to specific meals and make small, incremental improvements over time. The consistency of our meals allows us to easily identify the effects of any changes we make.

2. **Time Savings:** Automating the meal planning and grocery shopping process eliminates the need for constant decision-making and trips to the store, saving us a significant amount of time each week.

3. **Calorie Consistency:** By tracking our weight alongside our meal plan, we can adjust our calorie intake to maintain our desired weight. This consistent approach to calorie management helps us achieve our health and fitness goals more effectively.

## Challenges and Downsides

While the benefits of automated meal planning are numerous, there are some challenges to consider. Sticking to the plan can be difficult, especially when presented with other food options. It's important to be mindful of your body's needs and make adjustments when necessary, such as increasing calorie intake on days with more intense exercise.

Additionally, the lack of flexibility in the meal plan can be a drawback, as it may limit opportunities to share meals with others. However, for those who prioritize their health and efficiency, this sacrifice can be worthwhile.

## My Optimal Meal Plan

Our weekly meal plan focuses on incorporating nutrient-dense foods to support overall health and well-being. Some key components include:

- **Breakfast:** Skyr or yogurt with berries and nuts for calcium and antioxidants, and eggs for choline, which is important for brain function.
- **Lunch:** A rotation of salmon, chickpeas, lentils, minced meat, broccoli, cauliflower, and greens. We also include beetroot six days a week to improve running performance through increased nitric oxide production.

The overall goal is to prioritize healthy fats and protein while keeping carbohydrates, especially sugar, low.

## Conclusion

Automating my nutrition with Cronometer and weekly meal planning has been a game-changer for me. Not only has it saved me time and ensured that I consistently fuel my body with optimal nutrients, but it has also allowed me to fine-tune my diet over time. As an added bonus, my cooking skills have improved since embarking on this journey. While this approach may not be suitable for everyone, I encourage others to experiment and find what works best for their unique needs and lifestyle.
