# Introduction

Being ageless, or biologically immortal, means that your risk of death does not increase throughout your adult years. If circumstances are amazing, you could theoretically live **forever**. Tortoises are ageless.

# Part one: An age old problem

## On the origin of ageing

From mammals like us, to insects, plants and even single-celled organisms like yeast, ageing seems like a near-universal process of degeneration.
==pleiotropy==: The multifunctionality of single genes

## The birth of biogerontology

Genetic mutations caused worms to **eat less**, leading them to **live longer**.

## Why we age: Hallmarks of ageing

### Trouble in the Double Helix: DNA Damage & Mutations

DNA damage can occur, often resulting from sources like radiation therapy for cancer treatment.

### Trimmed Telomeres

Shortened telomeres in stem cells can lead to the loss of melanocytes and hair turning pure white.

The largest collection of telomere length data showed that individuals with the longest telomeres had a **40 percent lower** risk of death, even after accounting for age and other health-related factors.

### Protein Problems: Autophagy, Amyloids, and Adducts

Disrupting **autophagy** can prevent dietary restriction from extending lifespan. Adducts are proteins with sugar or **oxygen** side groups that hinder their function. They contribute to issues like poor eyesight, reduced bone strength, dementia, and other age-related effects. The accumulation of adducts is more pronounced with higher levels of **sugar** in the blood.

### Epigenetic Alterations

Highly correlated epigenetic changes, primarily through **methylation**, have shown a 96% association with actual age in a large sample.

### Accumulation of Senescent Cells

Short telomeres are responsible for replicative senescence in cells. Usually, senescent cells are removed by the immune system, but this can lead to inflammation, causing nearby cells to become senescent. Excessive senescent cells can contribute to conditions such as **cancer**, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and heart disease.

### Power Struggle: Malfunctioning Mitochondria

Mitophagy, which is the autophagy of malfunctioning mitochondria, worsens with age. Malfunctioning or insufficient mitochondria play a role in aging. Interestingly, free radicals generated by bad mitochondria serve as a means of cell-to-cell communication but do not cause aging.

### Signal Failure

Aging leads to a decline in signaling within the body, including hormonal signaling. Inflammation also intensifies with age, partly due to an increase in senescent cells and the accumulation of damaged or oxidized proteins. Additionally, aging may lead to the development of Insulin Resistance.

### Gut Reaction: Microbiome Changes

Dietary choices impact the composition of bacteria and viruses in the microbiome, which can significantly affect health. With age or a damaged microbiome, conditions like leaky gut may develop, allowing gut bacteria to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation.

### Cellular Exhaustion

Aging results in reduced numbers and effectiveness of stem cells. This can lead to a decline in taste, smell, and the shift from bone production to increased fat production.

### Defective Defenses: Immune System Malfunction

Over time, immune cells may lose effectiveness. Persistent illnesses can occupy a significant portion of T-cells, diminishing the immune system's ability to protect against other diseases. Cholesterol can form plaques in damaged artery spots, sometimes overwhelming immune cells. Oxygen and sugars can further react with cholesterol in plaques, emphasizing the importance of avoiding excessive sugar intake.

### Fixing the Hallmarks of Aging

Addressing these 10 hallmarks of aging presents a promising opportunity for intervention, offering potential solutions compared to dealing with the multitude of diseases associated with these hallmarks. Subsequent chapters will explore methods to combat aging.

# Part two: Treating ageing

## Out with the old

Removing the bad stuff that accumulates with ageing.

### Removing Senescent Cells

Senescent cells don't divide but cause inflammation, so they should be removed. Quercetin can kill senescent cells. Some senescent cells are useful, so we might treat their inflammation or try to convert them into normal cells.

### Boosting Autophagy

**Rapamycin** mimics fasting by blocking mTOR, signaling food scarcity and promoting autophagy. Lipofuscin, a waste product, is a potential cause of aging. We have various options to improve our waste disposal; we just need to activate them.

### Dealing with Amyloid Buildup

Amyloid-prone misfolded proteins create plaques. Although these plaques were once blamed for dementia, they're found in people without it. Cataracts or other substances can remove amyloids without causing inflammation. Cataracts are made by the immune system but decline with age. Studies in mice show cataracts can repeatedly eliminate amyloids, offering a potential solution to age-related plaque buildup.

## In with the new

### Stem Cell Therapy

Pluripotent or specific stem cells can replace stem cells. Using a patient's own stem cells avoids immune reactions.

### Boosting Immunity

Aging slows T-cell production in the thymus. Restoring the thymus can enhance immunity. Some methods have extended the lives of mice. Castrated individuals also show improved thymus function and increased lifespan.

Resetting the immune system can be powerful. CMV (herpes) can partially take over the immune system, and this can be achieved by replacing Hematopoietic stem cells.

### Modifying the Microbiome

Prebiotics feed good gut bacteria. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria. Combining them is called synbiotics.

Another option is **transferring** gut bacteria between individuals. This helps people with unhealthy microbiomes become more like those with healthy ones. This can be done directly or by ingesting capsules containing another person's feces.

### Preserving Collagen

Collagen is crucial for skin, joints, and bones. Damaged collagen (AGE) can lead to chronic inflammation. AGE-clearing supplements may help combat aging, though further research is needed.

Collagen naturally declines with age, resulting in frail bones and sagging skin. Fortunately, exercise appears to boost collagen production.

## Running repairs

### Telomere Lengthening

Longer telomeres promote longevity. Traditional telomerase-based lengthening can increase cancer risk. We need to find safer ways to extend telomeres without raising cancer risk, likely excluding telomerase.

### Young Blood's Influence

Young blood carries rejuvenating molecules that can reverse aging. Conversely, old blood contains molecules that accelerate aging in various body parts like the brain and liver. Filtering out harmful molecules from old blood and introducing rejuvenating compounds might slow down the aging process.

### Enhancing Mitochondria

Aging leads to reduced mitochondrial energy production. Free radicals harm mitochondria and their DNA. Supplying antioxidants to mitochondria could decelerate aging.

Mitochondria have vulnerable DNA prone to mutations. Copying part of this DNA into the cell nucleus can serve as a backup, enabling mitochondria to function effectively despite DNA defects.

### Preventing Cancer

Cancer typically arises from specific mutations. Identifying and eliminating cells containing these mutations can prevent cancer. Additionally, other strategies may exist for preventing cancer, though the chapter doesn't provide specific recommendations.

## Reprogramming ageing

### Genetic Enhancements

We can program genes to combat aging. Two key genes influence aging.

- APO-E has three variants: APO-E 2, 3, and 4. APO-E 2 protects against cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's, while 3 is most common. APO-E 4 carriers face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.
- FOXO3 mutations can significantly extend life by activating fasting-related genes, enhancing autophagy.

Gene therapy, involving direct gene editing using techniques like CRISPR, can bring about these beneficial changes. One example is PCSK9, which reduces heart disease risk by 88%.

### Reversing Epigenetic Aging

Cloning and activating certain genes with Yamanaka factors can reintroduce rejuvenated cells, but prolonged gene activation can lead to cancer. Transdifferentiation, changing cell types, is also an option for rejuvenation.

# Part three: Living longer

## The quest for a cure

Senolytics are molecules that kill senescent cells

## How to live long enough to live even longer

### 🚭 Don't **smoke**

### 🍏 Don't eat **too much**

🥦🥕🌾🥜 Fruit, vegetables, whole grains & nuts

### 😴 Sleep 8 hours a night

### 💉 Get vaccinated and **wash** your hands

And keep getting vaccinated

### 🦷 Take good care of your **teeth**

It's linked to longevity!

### ☀️ Wear sunscreen

### ❤️‍🔬 Monitor your heart rate and blood pressure

### 💊 Don't bother with supplements

Supplements have been tested in multiple controlled trials. Every time, they either had no effect, or in case of some supplements like vitamin E, slightly decreased longevity.

### ⏳ Don't bother with longevity drugs - yet

**Metformin** seems nice: simulates DR, used against diabetes. More evidence is needed though.

#### Metformin

Metformin is used to treat diabetes and is one of the most widely used medicines on the planet.

> Diabetics on metformin lived longer, not just than patients taking sulfonylureas, but **they beat non-diabetics by a small margin, too** - even though the patients without diabetes were healthier and less likely to be obese!
