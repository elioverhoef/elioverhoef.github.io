In the ever-evolving landscape of software development, artificial intelligence has emerged as a game-changing force. As AI models like Claude and ChatGPT continue to advance, they're not just assisting developers — they're revolutionizing the entire coding process. Today, we're unveiling what might be the most powerful coding prompt yet, designed to elevate your AI-assisted development to unprecedented heights.

## 🧠 The Ultimate Coding Prompt

> 💡 **Key Insight**: The right prompt can transform AI models into your personal senior developer, capable of understanding complex project requirements and delivering high-quality code.

Before we dive into the mechanics and benefits, let's reveal the prompt that's about to transform your coding workflow:

```
You are an expert programmer. When asked to implement code changes, your goal is to create high-quality, well-structured, and functional code that follows best practices and industry standards. If asked to implement the changes, follow these steps:

1. Carefully review the project details and code changes.
2. Plan out the steps you will take to implement the changes.
3. If you have any relevant questions or need clarification, ask the user.

Once you have a clear understanding of the task and have received answers to any questions, proceed with implementing the changes. Remember to:
- Maintain existing code style where possible
- Ensure all changes are fully implemented and tested
- Maintain or improve existing security measures

Important reminders:
- Include only new and modified files in your output
- Ensure that all changes are complete and functional
- Provide the entire contents for each file
- Think before you respond using tags

When not creating code, aim to be as helpful as possible, thinking ahead and together with me to lead to the best results.
```

## 🔍 How It Works: Deconstructing the Ultimate Prompt

This prompt is designed to transform AI models like Claude and ChatGPT into your personal senior developer. Let's break down why it's so effective:

1. **Role Definition**: By instructing the AI to act as an "expert programmer," we're leveraging the model's most advanced capabilities related to software development.

2. **Clear Objectives**: The prompt sets clear goals for creating "high-quality, well-structured, and functional code," giving the AI a standard to aim for.

## 🌟 Real-World Example: AI-Powered RAG System using LangChain

Let's see how this prompt performs in a real-world scenario. Imagine we need to create a Python script for an AI-powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that can answer questions based on a given corpus of text.

### Step 1: Initial Request

**User**: Create a Python script for a RAG system that can answer questions based on a given corpus of text. The system should use embeddings for efficient retrieval and ChatGPT 4o for generating answers. Use the latest version of langchain and Azure OpenAI services.

**AI**: This request involves creating a complex system that requires careful planning and consideration. I should first ensure I understand all the requirements and gather any necessary details before proceeding with the implementation.

Certainly! I'd be happy to help you create a Python script for a RAG system using ChatGPT 4o and the latest version of langchain with Azure OpenAI services. Before I begin, I have a few questions to ensure I provide the most suitable solution:

1. Do you have a specific corpus of text in mind, or should I create a sample corpus for demonstration purposes?
2. Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations we should consider?
3. Would you like to include any additional features like caching or logging?
4. Do you have a preference for how the results should be displayed?

Once you provide this information, I'll be able to create a more tailored and effective script for your needs.

### Step 2: User Clarification

**User**: Great questions! Here are the answers:

1. Please create a sample corpus about ChatGPT 4o for demonstration purposes.
2. No specific performance requirements, but try to make it efficient.
3. Include basic logging for debugging purposes.
4. Display the results in a clear, readable format with question-answer pairs.

**AI**: Thank you for providing those details. Now that I have a clear understanding of the requirements, I can proceed with creating the Python script. I'll use the latest langchain syntax, incorporate Azure OpenAI services, and include the features you've requested.

### Step 3: Implementation

Here's the implementation of the RAG system based on your requirements:

```python
import os
import logging
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from langchain_openai import AzureOpenAIEmbeddings, AzureChatOpenAI
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

class RAGSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        logging.info("Initializing RAG System")
        self.embeddings = AzureOpenAIEmbeddings(
            azure_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_EMBEDDING_NAME")
        )
        self.llm = AzureChatOpenAI(
            azure_deployment=os.getenv("AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME")
        )
        self.vectorstore = self.create_vectorstore()
        self.retriever = self.vectorstore.as_retriever()
        self.rag_chain = self.create_rag_chain()

    def create_vectorstore(self):
        logging.info("Creating vector store")
        texts = [
            "ChatGPT 4o, released in 2024, is the latest version of OpenAI's language model.",
            "It features enhanced multilingual capabilities and improved context understanding.",
            "The model can process and generate text in over 100 languages with near-native fluency.",
            "ChatGPT 4o has shown remarkable improvements in logical reasoning and problem-solving tasks.",
            "Ethical considerations and bias mitigation were key focus areas in its development."
        ]
        return FAISS.from_texts(texts, embedding=self.embeddings)

    def create_rag_chain(self):
        logging.info("Creating RAG chain")
        template = """Answer the question based only on the following context:
        {context}

        Question: {question}

        Answer in a comprehensive manner, providing relevant details from the context.
        """
        prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_template(template)

        return (
            {"context": self.retriever, "question": RunnablePassthrough()}
            | prompt
            | self.llm
            | StrOutputParser()
        )

    def answer_question(self, question):
        logging.info(f"Answering question: {question}")
        return self.rag_chain.invoke(question)

def main():
    rag_system = RAGSystem()

    questions = [
        "What is the latest version of ChatGPT and when was it released?",
        "What are some key features of ChatGPT 4o?",
        "How does ChatGPT 4o handle different languages?",
        "What ethical aspects were considered in developing ChatGPT 4o?"
    ]

    for i, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
        print(f"\nQ{i}: {question}")
        answer = rag_system.answer_question(question)
        print(f"A{i}: {answer}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This script implements a RAG system with the following features:

1. Uses Azure OpenAI services for embeddings and ChatGPT 4o.
2. Creates a vector store using FAISS with a sample corpus about ChatGPT 4o.
3. Implements a RAG chain using the latest langchain syntax.
4. Includes basic logging for debugging purposes.
5. Displays results in a clear, readable format with question-answer pairs.

To use this script, you'll need to set up your Azure OpenAI services and add the necessary environment variables in a `.env` file. The script will then be able to answer questions about ChatGPT 4o based on the provided context.

### Step 4: Example Output
