Over the years, I have had many different morning routines.

What stuck was: exercise.

I've done this for about 5 years now, and giving me a great start to the day.

I tried others apps as well, but since this app is so simple, I kept coming back to it.

It’s science supported to be a great workout for the whole body!

These exercises train the core as well, which is great for runners.

Replaced with another strength workout on Friday (variety)

1. It gets really easy after some time, it becomes automatic
2. You feel awake immediately
3. Your body stays in great shape with minimal effort
4. It gets me calm yet energized to get started on whatever I need to that day

## The workout

consists of 13 exercises, each for 30 seconds. You can change

- Duration
- 5 seconds break

you can increase duration as you progress.

you can do it practically anywhere, any time. All you need is something resembling a chair for the tricep dipcs, and a wall for the wall sit.

Let’s do the workout!

1. Jumping Jacks
2. Wall sit
3. Push ups
4. Sit ups
5. Step on chair (or any other object)
6. Squats
7. Tricep dips
8. Plank
9. High knees
10. Lunges
11. Push ups with rotation
12. Side plank right
13. Side plank left

## Measureable Results

Simple way to stay fit, although I also run & do pullups

The first result that has to be part of the workouts is that I can simply do a lot of push-ups.

Next, there is one general result from a study, that has shown what the 7M workout can do for anyone.

> For the initial study, researchers had 29 people between the ages of 18 and 30 trial a 7-minute workout every day for six weeks. After six weeks, the study showed that the people had decreased in the waist and hip circumference, a lower fat mass, and a lower BMI. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28085122/

For me, I went to the doctor's office at the National Sun Yat-Sen University campus, where I stepped on a scale that could measure my fat percentage.
It said 6.4%, but as I said earlier, this is most likely also due to running, and of course following a healthy diet. Now I’m at 5.3% according to the scale.

So download the app, and work out for yourself!
