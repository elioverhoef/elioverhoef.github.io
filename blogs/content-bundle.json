But what exactly is NMN, and why is it so important for our health?\n\n## Understanding NMN and NAD+\n\nNMN is a precursor molecule that the body converts into nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). NAD+ is one of the most abundant molecules in the body after water and plays a critical role in many cellular processes:\n\n- Generating energy in the mitochondria, the powerhouses of the cell\n- Regulating insulin secretion and sensitivity\n- Repairing and maintaining DNA integrity through activating sirtuins, a class of longevity-promoting enzymes\n\nInterestingly, NAD+ levels naturally decline as we age. This decrease is associated with a reduction in sirtuin activity, which has been linked to various age-related diseases. Therefore, boosting NAD+ levels through NMN supplementation has emerged as a promising strategy to combat aging and promote optimal health.\n\n## The Benefits of NMN Supplementation\n\n### 1. Lifespan Extension\n\nStudies in various animal models, including yeast, worms, and mice, have demonstrated that increasing NAD+ levels through NMN supplementation can activate sirtuins and extend lifespan. In one study, calorie restriction in mice led to a natural increase in NAD+ levels, which consequently slowed the aging process.\n\n### 2. Improved Mitochondrial Function\n\nNAD+ is essential for maintaining healthy mitochondrial function. By boosting NAD+ levels, NMN helps optimize energy production within the cells, leading to improved overall health and vitality.\n\n### 3. Cardiac Health and Neuroprotection\n\nNMN supplementation has been shown to improve heart function and protect against cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, it may prevent neurodegeneration and enhance memory, making it a potential therapeutic agent for age-related cognitive decline.\n\n### 4. Enhanced Insulin Sensitivity\n\nNMN can increase insulin sensitivity, allowing the body to more effectively remove excess sugar from the bloodstream. This improvement in insulin sensitivity can help prevent many metabolic disorders and promote overall health.\n\n### 5. Increased Muscle Endurance and Strength\n\nStudies have indicated that NMN supplementation can improve muscle endurance and strength, especially in older individuals. This includes enhancements in walking speed, chair rising ability, and grip strength.\n\n## Dosage and Safety\n\nNMN is generally considered safe, with no known side effects at doses up to 500 mg per day. However, research on higher doses (e.g., 1 g per day) is limited, particularly in elderly and heavier individuals.\n\nRecommended daily dosages based on age and weight:\n\n- Young, light individuals: 500 mg\n- Older (50+) or heavier (90+ kg) individuals: 750 mg\n- Older and heavier individuals: 1 g\n\n## Conclusion\n\nNMN shows great promise as a supplemental approach to promoting longevity, optimizing health, and combating age-related diseases. By boosting NAD+ levels, NMN can activate crucial longevity pathways, improve mitochondrial function, protect the heart and brain, enhance insulin sensitivity, and increase muscle strength and endurance.\n\nAs with any supplement, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting NMN supplementation. While NMN is generally safe, individual responses may vary, and long-term effects, especially at higher doses, require further research.\n\nEmbracing a holistic approach that includes a balanced diet, regular exercise, stress management, and targeted supplementation like NMN may be the key to unlocking our full potential for health and longevity. As the science behind NMN continues to evolve, it will be exciting to see how this remarkable molecule shapes the future of aging research and personalized health optimization.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5sWaNNf_zyQ\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n",

As an intermediate AI user, you've likely scratched the surface of what's possible with large language models. But are you truly harnessing the full potential of Claude AI? In this comprehensive guide, we'll dive deep into advanced techniques, real-world applications, and insider tips that will transform your interactions with Claude AI and skyrocket your productivity.\n\n## The Game-Changing Power of Asking Questions\n\n> üí° **Key Insight**: Encouraging Claude to ask questions leads to more precise and tailored outputs.\n\nOne of the most potent yet often overlooked features of Claude AI is its ability to ask clarifying questions. This simple technique can dramatically improve the quality and relevance of the AI's outputs. Let me share a personal anecdote that illustrates this point perfectly.\n\nWhen I sat down to write this very article, instead of spending hours brainstorming and outlining, I turned to Claude AI. I provided a brief overview of what I wanted to achieve and asked Claude to ask me questions about the content. This initiated a collaborative process where Claude inquired about specific aspects of the article, target audience, tone, and key points to cover.\n\nThis approach not only saved me time but also helped refine the article's focus and structure. By answering Claude's questions, I was able to provide the AI with precise context and expectations, resulting in a more tailored and comprehensive outline.\n\n## The Questioning Technique in Action\n\nLet's break down this technique into actionable steps:\n\n1. **Initial Prompt**: Start with a clear, but open-ended request. Example: \"I want to create a comprehensive guide on using Claude AI for software development. Can you ask me questions to help refine this idea?\"\n2. **Answer Thoroughly**: When Claude asks questions, provide detailed answers. The more context you give, the better the final output will be.\n3. **Iterate**: Don't hesitate to ask Claude for more questions if you feel certain aspects haven't been covered.\n4. **Summarize**: After the Q&A session, ask Claude to summarize the key points. This ensures you're both aligned on the task at hand.\n\nBy employing this technique, you're essentially co-creating with Claude, leveraging both its vast knowledge base and your specific expertise and requirements.\n\n## Common Pitfalls and How to Avoid Them\n\n![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*4_x0NhfhrGhvWVK5)\n\nAs intermediate users, it's easy to fall into certain traps when using Claude AI. Let's explore some common mistakes and how to avoid them:\n\n### 1. Vague Prompts\n\n**Pitfall**: Providing unclear or incomplete instructions.\n\n**Example**: \"Write a function\"\n\n**Solution**: \"Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. Include error handling and optimize for performance.\"\n\n### 2. Unspecified Output Format\n\n**Pitfall**: Not specifying the desired format for Claude's response.\n\n**Example**: \"Give me information about solar panels\"\n\n**Solution**: \"Create a markdown-formatted FAQ section with 5 common questions and answers about residential solar panel installation.\"\n\n### 3. Ignoring Multiturn Capabilities\n\n**Pitfall**: Starting a new query for each related question instead of building on previous interactions.\n\n**Example**: Asking separate, disconnected questions about a topic.\n\n**Solution**: Build on previous interactions. For instance, \"Referring to the solar panel FAQ we just created, can you now generate a cost comparison table?\"\n\n### 4. Forgetting Claude's Limitations\n\n**Pitfall**: Asking Claude to perform tasks it's not capable of, like accessing real-time data.\n\n**Example**: \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\"\n\n**Solution**: \"Can you provide a template for tracking cryptocurrency prices, including fields for date, time, and price in USD?\"\n\n## Detailed Breakdown of Common Pitfalls\n\n**Vague or Incomplete Prompts**\n\n- Remember, Claude is incredibly capable, but it's not a mind reader! Always write as if you're talking to someone else over text, providing full context of what exactly you'd like to achieve (and how).\n- **Instead of**: \"Write a function\" **Try**: \"Create a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number. The function should take an integer as input and return a list of Fibonacci numbers. Please include error handling for invalid inputs and optimize for performance.\"\n\n**Forgetting to Specify the Output Format**\n\n- Claude can generate content in various formats, but you need to be explicit about what you want.\n- **Instead of**: \"Give me information about solar panels\" **Try**: \"Create a markdown-formatted FAQ section with 5 common questions and answers about residential solar panel installation. Include technical details but make it understandable for homeowners.\"\n\n**Not Leveraging Claude's Multiturn Capabilities**\n\n- Many users treat each interaction with Claude as isolated, missing out on the power of context-aware conversations.\n- **Instead of**: Starting a new query for each related question **Try**: Building on previous interactions. For example: \"Referring to the solar panel FAQ we just created, can you now generate a cost comparison table between traditional electricity and solar power over a 10-year period?\"\n\n**Ignoring Claude's Limitations**\n\n- While incredibly powerful, Claude has limitations. It can't access real-time data, perform actual computations, or access information from different chat threads.\n- **Instead of**: \"What's the current price of Bitcoin?\" **Try**: \"Can you provide a template for tracking cryptocurrency prices, including fields for date, time, and price in USD?\"\n\nBy avoiding these pitfalls and following best practices, you'll get much more value out of your interactions with Claude AI.\n\n## ProjectCodr: A Testament to Claude's Capabilities\n\n![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*Le9qHvg97mjRXXdW)\n\nTo truly appreciate the power of Claude AI, let's look at a real-world application that pushes the boundaries of what's possible with AI-assisted development.

Define the Flow Chart**: Ask Claude to generate a mermaid diagram:\n\n- `Create a mermaid flow chart that visualizes the ProjectCodr workflow, from user input to final code generation.`\n\n**2. Generate the Mermaid Code**: Claude will provide the mermaid code for your flow chart.\n\n```\ngraph LR\n  A[User Input] --> B{AI Designs Structure}\n  B --> C[Generate Code for Modules]\n  C --> D[Validate & Optimize]\n  D --> E[User Edits]\n  E --> F{Further Refinement Needed?}\n  F --Yes--> C\n  F --No--> G[Final Code Project]\n```\n\n![Flow generated by Claude AI](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*2CzCAUUT0kW3vxb32PQWtg.png)\n\n**3. Refine the Flow Chart**: Ask Claude to make adjustments or add more detail:\n\n- `Can you update the flow chart to include a step for user authentication and project saving?`\n\n**4. Implement the Flow Chart**: Use the mermaid code in your project documentation, presentations, or applications.\n\nThis process demonstrates how Claude can assist in creating visual aids that enhance understanding and communication of complex processes. The same approach can be applied to creating other types of diagrams, such as entity-relationship diagrams for databases or architecture diagrams for software systems.\n\n## Optimizing Claude's Performance\n\nTo get the most out of Claude, it's crucial to optimize its performance for specific tasks. Here are some advanced techniques to enhance your interactions:\n\n### 1. Role Specification\n\nSpecifying Claude's role at the beginning of your interaction can lead to a 15% improvement in performance on the given task. Here's an example of a system prompt for coding projects:\n\n```\nYou are an expert programmer. If you are asked to implement something and things are not really clear or you need documentation, then ask all relevant questions needed to get to a great implementation. When implementing, give only the output files and no other text.\n```\n\nBy setting this context upfront, Claude is primed to approach the task from the perspective of an expert programmer, leading to more accurate and efficient code generation.\n\n### 2. Chain of Thought Prompting\n\nFor complex reasoning tasks, use chain of thought prompting. This technique involves asking Claude to break down its thinking process step by step. For example:\n\n```\nLet's approach this problem step by step:\n1) First, let's identify the key variables in this coding challenge.\n2) Next, let's consider the most efficient data structure for this task.\n3) Then, let's outline the main functions we'll need.\n4) ...\n```\n\nThis method not only often leads to more accurate results but also allows you to understand and verify Claude's reasoning process.\n\n### 3. Few-Shot Learning\n\nProvide Claude with a few examples of the type of output you're looking for. This can significantly improve the relevance and format of Claude's responses. For instance:\n\n```\nI need you to generate Python docstrings for functions. Here's an example:\n\ndef add(a: int, b: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Add two integers and return the result.\n\n    Args:\n        a (int): The first integer.\n        b (int): The second integer.\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The sum of a and b.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n\nNow, please generate a docstring for the following function:\n\ndef fibonacci(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    # Function implementation here\n```\n\n### 4. Iterative Refinement\n\nDon't expect perfect results on the first try. Use an iterative approach, where you refine Claude's output over multiple interactions. For example:\n\n1. Generate initial code\n2. Review and identify areas for improvement\n3. Ask Claude to refactor or optimize specific parts\n4. Repeat until satisfied\n\nThis approach mimics real-world software development practices and often leads to higher quality results.\n\n## Real-World Applications\n\nWhile Claude excels in coding tasks, its capabilities extend far beyond software development. Here are some areas where Claude has proven particularly effective:\n\n### 1. Updating Documents\n\nClaude can quickly update existing documentation, ensuring it remains current and accurate.

Code Refactoring\n\nWhen asking Claude to refactor code, be specific about your goals. For example:\n\n```\nPlease refactor the following Python function to improve its performance and readability. Specifically:\n1) Reduce time complexity if possible\n2) Improve variable naming\n3) Add type hints\n4) Ensure it follows PEP 8 style guidelines\n\nHere's the function:\n\ndef f(x,y):\n z=[]\n for i in range(len(x)):\n  if x[i]>y:\n   z.append(x[i])\n return z\n```\n\n### 2. Designing System Architecture\n\nWhen using Claude for system design tasks, provide context and constraints. For example:\n\n```\nI need to design a scalable microservices architecture for an e-commerce platform. The system should handle:\n1) User authentication\n2) Product catalog management\n3) Order processing\n4) Inventory management\n5) Payment processing\n\nConstraints:\n- Expected to handle 10,000 concurrent users\n- Must be cloud-agnostic\n- Needs to integrate with legacy inventory system\n\nPlease provide a high-level architecture diagram (in text form) and explain the key components and their interactions.\n```\n\n### 3. Debugging Code\n\nWhen asking Claude for help with debugging, provide as much context as possible:\n\n```\nI'm encountering a bug in my Python script. Here's the relevant code:\n\ndef process_data(data):\n    result = []\n    for item in data:\n        value = item['value']\n        processed = value * 2 + 1\n        result.append(processed)\n    return result\n\ndata = [{'value': 1}, {'value': 2}, {'value': '3'}]\nprint(process_data(data))\n\nThe error message I'm getting is:\nTypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'int'\n\nCan you help me identify the issue and suggest a fix?\n```\n\nBy providing the full context ‚Äî including the code, input data, and error message ‚Äî you enable Claude to provide more accurate and helpful debugging assistance.\n\n## Conclusion: The Future of AI-Assisted Development\n\n![captionless image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/0*1eXRuOJyq6yaGv55)\n\nAs we've seen through examples like ProjectCodr, the future of software development is being shaped by AI assistants like Claude.

  "2023-09-15-improving-sleep.md": "---\ntitle: \"16 Science-Based Tips for Better Sleep\"\ndate: 2023-09-15\npermalink: /posts/2023/09/sleep/\ntags:\n  - sleep\n  - caffeine\n  - alcohol\n  - light\n  - sunlight\n  - temperature\n  - sound\n  - consistency\n  - relaxation\n  - supplements\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nHi, I‚Äôm Elio, and I will try to help you sleep better.\n\nPeople who have bad sleep not only live shorter [1] , they will have less energy during the day [2].\n\nI will discuss 16 practical tips for improving your sleep, based on science. I will also discuss which of these I‚Äôve implemented myself, and to what degree that has helped my sleep.\n\nIt‚Äôs quite a very large list, so it would be unreasonable to try everything at once.\n\nIt might be better to identify one of these factors that could be having the greatest impact on your sleep, and then focus on implementing just that one thing before implementing another one.\n\n## Basic tips for improving sleep\n\n1. View sunlight directly after wakeup\n   1. Sets the circadian clock, such that you become sleepy in the late afternoon and evening!\n      1. The earlier you view morning sunlight, the more you shift your circadian rhythm forwards, causing an earlier release of melatonin. [3]\n   2. I got this from the one person who is known specifically for this advice - [Andrew Huberman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDv4AWk0J3U)\n2. Limit ANY light close to bedtime, specifically blue light\n   1. Blue light limits the production of melatonin, the hormone making you sleepy [4]\n   2. Also try to keep the room dark during the night. The light receptors disrupting melatonin production get to work very quickly, so even if you use a flashlight for only a second or two, it can have negative effects on sleep.\n3. Keep your environment cool: 18 Celsius or 65 Fahrenheit\n   1. Based on general recommendations [5]. A cool environment is especially important for falling asleep.\n      If this is not an option, maybe use a fan or only use the blanket sheet - the thin cloth you put around the blanket.\n4. Do not take in caffeine in the first 90 minutes of being awake.\n   1. That would spike your cortisol even higher in the morning, causing adverse effects to the circadian rhythm\n   2. Couldn‚Äôt find study, yet another thing I took from Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. You can watch his entire podcast on caffeine here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw97uvIge7c\n5. Stop taking any caffeine (coffee, tea) 12 hours before going to sleep.\n   1. Half-life caffeine = 5 hours, but even slight amounts of caffeine have a noticeable negative effect on sleep. [6]\n   2. The earlier you stop drinking, the better.\n6. Do not drink alcohol close to bed\n   1. Greatly harms sleep quality, so it‚Äôs best to not take it at all. I‚Äôve heard this from people who drink alcohol and have sleep trackers: This is one of the, if not the greatest source of bad sleep.\n      1. Science also supports this: **Source**\n      2. If you do take alcohol, try to not take it close to bed. A guideline I found online says not to take it within 4 hours of sleeping [7].\n7. Do not eat anything in the 3 hours preceding sleep. [8]\n8. Limit fluid intake in the 3 hours (or more) before sleep if having to pee is waking you up at night.\n   1. Drinking very slowly, or sipping the water instead of taking big gulps, also helps with this. When you would drink a lot of water at once, your body‚Äôs immediate reaction is to get rid of the water in order to keep total blood volume down. [9]\n9. Get a good mattress\n10. Take a hot shower or bath\n    1. External heating cools down the body afterwards, allowing for improved sleep\n    2. The relaxation also helps with falling asleep [10]\n11. Limited sounds\n    1. Sounds can keep you up, or wake you up\n    2. If you live in a noisy environment, consider using white noise to drown out the background noise, as well as earplugs.\n\n## Advanced improvements\n\n1. Get a temperature controlled mattress - quite expensive [11]\n2. Setup a wake-up light\n   1. Using the Idinio app, I can controll the E23 light bulb that only costs 13 euro\n      1. https://www.123led.nl/Idinio-Smart-wifi-lamp-E27-Idinio-9W-RGB-2700K-6500K-i7550-t3889.html\n3. Very consistent sleep timing\n   1. Go to sleep at roughly same time, differing a maximum of 30 minutes between days. [12]\n4. Prevent alarms: They can cut your sleep during REM and deep sleep stages. [13]\n5. Supplements [Highly optional]: **Magnesium threonate** [145mg], **l-theanine** [100-400mg], and **apigenin** [50mg]\n   1. All of these reduce anxiety and promote relaxation to fall asleep faster.\n   2. Apigenin is actually found in high dosages in chamomile tea, causing its relaxing effects\n   3. Once again, I got these supplement recommendations from Andrew Huberman.\n\n## What I‚Äôve done\n\n1. As you might know, I don‚Äôt drink alcohol\n2. Wakeup light & No alarm\n3. I go for a walk outside to view sunlight when directly after I wake up\n4. No exercise in the second half of the day\n5. If I take caffeine, before 12:00\n6. I don‚Äôt eat in the late afternoon/evening, see my video on this: ‚ÄúEat early, sleep better‚Äù\n   1. This has greatly improved the quality of my sleep\n7. No water 5 hours before sleep\n   1. Less waking up at night (although still happens sometimes, don‚Äôt know why)\n8. I limit any light in the evening, and use my automatic lamp to emit dim, purely red light\n9. No devices 1 hour before sleep\n10. A bit of reading\n11. I sometimes take a warm shower before sleep\n    1. This helps a lot! Being relaxed makes it so much easier to fall asleep.\n12. Moderately consistent sleep timing\n13. Occasionally using a fan when it‚Äôs hot - these days it‚Äôs 31 or 32 degrees during the day - in September in the Netherlands!\n14.

  "2023-10-05-automating-optimal-nutrition.md": "---\ntitle: \"Automating Optimal Nutrition: My Experience with Cronometer and Weekly Meal Planning\"\ndate: 2023-10-05\npermalink: /posts/2023/10/automating-optimal-nutrition/\ntags:\n  - Nutrition\n  - Meal Planning\n  - Automation\n  - Health\n  - Efficiency\n  - Cronometer\n  - Macronutrients\n  - Micronutrients\n  - Calorie Tracking\n  - Continuous Improvement\n---\n\nAs someone who values health and efficiency, I recently discovered a tool called Cronometer that has revolutionized the way I approach my nutrition. Cronometer allows users to easily plan and track their food intake based on extensive databases of various foods. Inspired by this, my brother and I set out to design an \"optimal\" meal plan for the week, focusing on balanced macronutrients, micronutrients, variety, and ease of preparation.\n\n## Automating the Process\n\nTo streamline our weekly nutrition plan, we began using an automated delivery service from a nearby supermarket. By creating a premade list of all the necessary items, we can simply add them to our order and have them delivered once a week. This automation saves us valuable time and ensures that we always have the ingredients we need to stick to our plan.\n\n## Benefits of Automated Meal Planning\n\n1. **Continuous Improvement:** By consistently eating a healthy, well-balanced diet, we can monitor how our bodies respond to specific meals and make small, incremental improvements over time. The consistency of our meals allows us to easily identify the effects of any changes we make.\n\n2. **Time Savings:** Automating the meal planning and grocery shopping process eliminates the need for constant decision-making and trips to the store, saving us a significant amount of time each week.\n\n3. **Calorie Consistency:** By tracking our weight alongside our meal plan, we can adjust our calorie intake to maintain our desired weight. This consistent approach to calorie management helps us achieve our health and fitness goals more effectively.\n\n## Challenges and Downsides\n\nWhile the benefits of automated meal planning are numerous, there are some challenges to consider. Sticking to the plan can be difficult, especially when presented with other food options. It's important to be mindful of your body's needs and make adjustments when necessary, such as increasing calorie intake on days with more intense exercise.\n\nAdditionally, the lack of flexibility in the meal plan can be a drawback, as it may limit opportunities to share meals with others. However, for those who prioritize their health and efficiency, this sacrifice can be worthwhile.\n\n## My Optimal Meal Plan\n\nOur weekly meal plan focuses on incorporating nutrient-dense foods to support overall health and well-being. Some key components include:\n\n- **Breakfast:** Skyr or yogurt with berries and nuts for calcium and antioxidants, and eggs for choline, which is important for brain function.\n- **Lunch:** A rotation of salmon, chickpeas, lentils, minced meat, broccoli, cauliflower, and greens. We also include beetroot six days a week to improve running performance through increased nitric oxide production.\n\nThe overall goal is to prioritize healthy fats and protein while keeping carbohydrates, especially sugar, low.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nAutomating my nutrition with Cronometer and weekly meal planning has been a game-changer for me. Not only has it saved me time and ensured that I consistently fuel my body with optimal nutrients, but it has also allowed me to fine-tune my diet over time. As an added bonus, my cooking skills have improved since embarking on this journey. While this approach may not be suitable for everyone, I encourage others to experiment and find what works best for their unique needs and lifestyle.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iBRw3O0ecY0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
  "2023-12-31-optimized-morning-routine.md": "---\ntitle: \"My Optimized Morning Routine for Health and Productivity\"\ndate: 2023-12-31\npermalink: /posts/2023/12/optimized-morning-routine/\ntags:\n  - Morning Routine\n  - Health\n  - Productivity\n  - Supplements\n  - Exercise\n  - Intermittent Fasting\n  - Journaling\n  - Breakfast\n  - Creatine\n---\n\nAs someone who is passionate about optimizing my health and productivity, I have developed a morning routine that sets me up for success throughout the day. In this blog post, I will share the key elements of my routine and explain how each component contributes to my overall well-being.\n\n## Making the Bed and Taking Supplements\n\nI always start my day by making my bed, as it helps me feel a sense of accomplishment and sets a positive tone for the day ahead. After that, I take several supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and vitamin D. I also drink a significant amount of water with some salt to ensure proper hydration after a night of sleep.\n\n## Full Body Workout and Artificial Sunlight\n\nBefore going for a run, I perform a full-body workout called the \"7-Minute Workout.\" This workout consists of 13 exercises, each performed for 30 seconds:\n\n1. Jumping jacks\n2. Wall sit\n3. Push-ups\n4. Crunches\n5. Step-ups onto a chair\n6. Squats\n7. Tricep dips on a chair\n8. Plank\n9. High knees\n10. Lunges\n11. Push-ups with rotation\n12. Side plank (right)\n13. Side plank (left)\n\nDuring the workout, I turn on my 10,000 lux light to simulate morning sunlight, especially during the winter months when natural sunlight is limited.\n\n## Running and Journaling\n\nAfter brushing my teeth and doing some journaling, I put on my running shoes and do a brief warm-up. Then, I start my run as programmed into my Coros running watch. Running is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular health and boost mental clarity.\n\n## Breakfast and Intermittent Fasting\n\nFollowing my run, I have my breakfast, which is essentially my entire day's worth of food. I practice intermittent fasting, meaning I only eat in the morning and do not have lunch or dinner. My breakfast consists of three main components:\n\n1. **4 eggs with spices and salt:** Eggs are a great source of protein and essential nutrients.\n2. **Skyr with various toppings:** I combine about 200 grams of skyr (a type of Icelandic yogurt) with 30 grams each of blueberries and raspberries, 15 grams of pumpkin seeds (a good source of magnesium), cacao nibs, 40 grams of a nut mix (containing walnuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, etc.), 30 grams of peanut butter, and 5 grams of creatine. Creatine has been shown to support mental function.\n3. **A third meal that varies daily:** This often includes minced meat with vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy consistently following this optimized morning routine, I have found that I am better prepared to tackle the challenges of the day. The combination of supplements, exercise, journaling, and a nutritious breakfast provides me with the physical and mental energy I need to perform at my best. While everyone's ideal routine may differ, I encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you in terms of promoting health and productivity.\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yub4IVO_v3A\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
  "2024-02-22-ageless.md": "---\ntitle: \"Ageless Summary: The New Science of Getting Older Without Getting Old\"\ndate: 2024-02-22\npermalink: /posts/2024/02/ageless/\ntags:\n  - ageing\n  - longevity\n  - ageless\n  - health\n  - supplements\n  - metformin\n  - fasting\n  - calorie restriction\n  - telomeres\n  - autophagy\n  - practical tips\n---\n\n# Introduction\n\nBeing ageless, or biologically immortal, means that your risk of death does not increase throughout your adult years. If circumstances are amazing, you could theoretically live **forever**. Tortoises are ageless.\n\n# Part one: An age old problem\n\n## On the origin of ageing\n\nFrom mammals like us, to insects, plants and even single-celled organisms like yeast, ageing seems like a near-universal process of degeneration.\n==pleiotropy==: The multifunctionality of single genes\n\n## The birth of biogerontology\n\nGenetic mutations caused worms to **eat less**, leading them to **live longer**.\n\n## Why we age: Hallmarks of ageing\n\n### Trouble in the Double Helix: DNA Damage & Mutations\n\nDNA damage can occur, often resulting from sources like radiation therapy for cancer treatment.\n\n### Trimmed Telomeres\n\nShortened telomeres in stem cells can lead to the loss of melanocytes and hair turning pure white.\n\nThe largest collection of telomere length data showed that individuals with the longest telomeres had a **40 percent lower** risk of death, even after accounting for age and other health-related factors.\n\n### Protein Problems: Autophagy, Amyloids, and Adducts\n\nDisrupting **autophagy** can prevent dietary restriction from extending lifespan. Adducts are proteins with sugar or **oxygen** side groups that hinder their function. They contribute to issues like poor eyesight, reduced bone strength, dementia, and other age-related effects. The accumulation of adducts is more pronounced with higher levels of **sugar** in the blood.\n\n### Epigenetic Alterations\n\nHighly correlated epigenetic changes, primarily through **methylation**, have shown a 96% association with actual age in a large sample.\n\n### Accumulation of Senescent Cells\n\nShort telomeres are responsible for replicative senescence in cells. Usually, senescent cells are removed by the immune system, but this can lead to inflammation, causing nearby cells to become senescent. Excessive senescent cells can contribute to conditions such as **cancer**, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and heart disease.\n\n### Power Struggle: Malfunctioning Mitochondria\n\nMitophagy, which is the autophagy of malfunctioning mitochondria, worsens with age. Malfunctioning or insufficient mitochondria play a role in aging. Interestingly, free radicals generated by bad mitochondria serve as a means of cell-to-cell communication but do not cause aging.\n\n### Signal Failure\n\nAging leads to a decline in signaling within the body, including hormonal signaling. Inflammation also intensifies with age, partly due to an increase in senescent cells and the accumulation of damaged or oxidized proteins. Additionally, aging may lead to the development of Insulin Resistance.\n\n### Gut Reaction: Microbiome Changes\n\nDietary choices impact the composition of bacteria and viruses in the microbiome, which can significantly affect health. With age or a damaged microbiome, conditions like leaky gut may develop, allowing gut bacteria to enter the bloodstream and trigger inflammation.\n\n### Cellular Exhaustion\n\nAging results in reduced numbers and effectiveness of stem cells. This can lead to a decline in taste, smell, and the shift from bone production to increased fat production.\n\n### Defective Defenses: Immune System Malfunction\n\nOver time, immune cells may lose effectiveness. Persistent illnesses can occupy a significant portion of T-cells, diminishing the immune system's ability to protect against other diseases. Cholesterol can form plaques in damaged artery spots, sometimes overwhelming immune cells. Oxygen and sugars can further react with cholesterol in plaques, emphasizing the importance of avoiding excessive sugar intake.\n\n### Fixing the Hallmarks of Aging\n\nAddressing these 10 hallmarks of aging presents a promising opportunity for intervention, offering potential solutions compared to dealing with the multitude of diseases associated with these hallmarks. Subsequent chapters will explore methods to combat aging.\n\n# Part two: Treating ageing\n\n## Out with the old\n\nRemoving the bad stuff that accumulates with ageing.\n\n### Removing Senescent Cells\n\nSenescent cells don't divide but cause inflammation, so they should be removed. Quercetin can kill senescent cells. Some senescent cells are useful, so we might treat their inflammation or try to convert them into normal cells.\n\n### Boosting Autophagy\n\n**Rapamycin** mimics fasting by blocking mTOR, signaling food scarcity and promoting autophagy. Lipofuscin, a waste product, is a potential cause of aging. We have various options to improve our waste disposal; we just need to activate them.\n\n### Dealing with Amyloid Buildup\n\nAmyloid-prone misfolded proteins create plaques. Although these plaques were once blamed for dementia, they're found in people without it. Cataracts or other substances can remove amyloids without causing inflammation. Cataracts are made by the immune system but decline with age. Studies in mice show cataracts can repeatedly eliminate amyloids, offering a potential solution to age-related plaque buildup.\n\n## In with the new\n\n### Stem Cell Therapy\n\nPluripotent or specific stem cells can replace stem cells. Using a patient's own stem cells avoids immune reactions.\n\n### Boosting Immunity\n\nAging slows T-cell production in the thymus. Restoring the thymus can enhance immunity. Some methods have extended the lives of mice. Castrated individuals also show improved thymus function and increased lifespan.\n\nResetting the immune system can be powerful. CMV (herpes) can partially take over the immune system, and this can be achieved by replacing Hematopoietic stem cells.\n\n### Modifying the Microbiome\n\nPrebiotics feed good gut bacteria. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria. Combining them is called synbiotics.\n\nAnother option is **transferring** gut bacteria between individuals. This helps people with unhealthy microbiomes become more like those with healthy ones. This can be done directly or by ingesting capsules containing another person's feces.\n\n### Preserving Collagen\n\nCollagen is crucial for skin, joints, and bones. Damaged collagen (AGE) can lead to chronic inflammation. AGE-clearing supplements may help combat aging, though further research is needed.\n\nCollagen naturally declines with age, resulting in frail bones and sagging skin. Fortunately, exercise appears to boost collagen production.\n\n## Running repairs\n\n### Telomere Lengthening\n\nLonger telomeres promote longevity. Traditional telomerase-based lengthening can increase cancer risk. We need to find safer ways to extend telomeres without raising cancer risk, likely excluding telomerase.\n\n### Young Blood's Influence\n\nYoung blood carries rejuvenating molecules that can reverse aging. Conversely, old blood contains molecules that accelerate aging in various body parts like the brain and liver. Filtering out harmful molecules from old blood and introducing rejuvenating compounds might slow down the aging process.\n\n### Enhancing Mitochondria\n\nAging leads to reduced mitochondrial energy production. Free radicals harm mitochondria and their DNA. Supplying antioxidants to mitochondria could decelerate aging.\n\nMitochondria have vulnerable DNA prone to mutations. Copying part of this DNA into the cell nucleus can serve as a backup, enabling mitochondria to function effectively despite DNA defects.\n\n### Preventing Cancer\n\nCancer typically arises from specific mutations. Identifying and eliminating cells containing these mutations can prevent cancer. Additionally, other strategies may exist for preventing cancer, though the chapter doesn't provide specific recommendations.\n\n## Reprogramming ageing\n\n### Genetic Enhancements\n\nWe can program genes to combat aging. Two key genes influence aging.\n\n- APO-E has three variants: APO-E 2, 3, and 4. APO-E 2 protects against cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's, while 3 is most common. APO-E 4 carriers face a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's.\n- FOXO3 mutations can significantly extend life by activating fasting-related genes, enhancing autophagy.\n\nGene therapy, involving direct gene editing using techniques like CRISPR, can bring about these beneficial changes. One example is PCSK9, which reduces heart disease risk by 88%.\n\n### Reversing Epigenetic Aging\n\nCloning and activating certain genes with Yamanaka factors can reintroduce rejuvenated cells, but prolonged gene activation can lead to cancer. Transdifferentiation, changing cell types, is also an option for rejuvenation.\n\n# Part three: Living longer\n\n## The quest for a cure\n\nSenolytics are molecules that kill senescent cells\n\n## How to live long enough to live even longer\n\n### üö≠ Don't **smoke**\n\n### üçè Don't eat **too much**\n\nü•¶ü•ïüåæü•ú Fruit, vegetables, whole grains & nuts\n\n### üò¥ Sleep 8 hours a night\n\n### üíâ Get vaccinated and **wash** your hands\n\nAnd keep getting vaccinated\n\n### ü¶∑ Take good care of your **teeth**\n\nIt's linked to longevity!\n\n### ‚òÄÔ∏è Wear sunscreen\n\n### ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî¨ Monitor your heart rate and blood pressure\n\n### üíä Don't bother with supplements\n\nSupplements have been tested in multiple controlled trials. Every time, they either had no effect, or in case of some supplements like vitamin E, slightly decreased longevity.\n\n### ‚è≥ Don't bother with longevity drugs - yet\n\n**Metformin** seems nice: simulates DR, used against diabetes. More evidence is needed though.\n\n#### Metformin\n\nMetformin is used to treat diabetes and is one of the most widely used medicines on the planet.\n\n> Diabetics on metformin lived longer, not just than patients taking sulfonylureas, but **they beat non-diabetics by a small margin, too** - even though the patients without diabetes were healthier and less likely to be obese!\n",

I might be wrong\n2. There are contradicting studies out there since studies can be performed incorrectly, or with a small sample size.\n   What I think I know now might not be the truth, as biology is complicated and researchers can have biases and hidden agendas.\n\n# 1. People with a fat-based diet live **longer**\n\nLet‚Äôs start with the broad picture.\n\nA longitudal study from 2017 found that high carbohydrate intake was associated with a higher risk of mortality, while high fat intake was associated with a lower risk of mortality. Participants with the highest carbohydrate intake (77% of calories) were 28% more likely to have died, while those with the highest fat intake (35% of calories) were 23% less likely to have died. Higher saturated fat intake was also associated with a lower riswk of strokes.\n\n- Dehghan, M., Mente, A., Zhang, X., Swaminathan, S., Li, W., Mohan, V., ... & Garcia, R. (2017). Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE): a prospective cohort study.¬†*The Lancet*,¬†*390*(10107), 2050-2062. [2]\n- A study from the Journal of Alzheimer found that [people whose diets were highest in fat ‚Äî compared to the lowest ‚Äî were 42 percent less likely to face cognitive impairment](https://www.j-alz.com/content/eating-lots-carbs-sugar-may-raise-risk-cognitive-impairment-mayo-clinic-study-finds).\n- I have been following eating relatively high fat for my time in Taiwan, and feel great.\n\n# 2. What about saturated fat? Is that healthy?\n\n- According to the American Heart Association **today**, it is NOT, since it increases LDL ‚Äúbad‚Äù cholesterol. [[3]](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day).\n- But is LDL cholesterol actually bad?\n- A study of 136,000 patients admitted to the hospital for a coronary artery event found that nearly 50% of them had a low **LDL cholesterol** level, despite the common belief that high LDL cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. [[4]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335519300592?via%3Dihub)\n- **A recent meta analysis, which is basically a study of lots of different studies, found that higher LDL cholesterol was associated with greater longevity & thus lower mortality! The analysis was performed on 19 studies, with a total patient count of 6 million.** [[5]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347488140_The_LDL_Paradox_Higher_LDL-Cholesterol_is_Associated_with_Greater_Longevity_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution_40_International_License)\n\n# 3. What about trans fats?\n\n- Trans fats come in two types: natural and artificial.\n  - Natural trans fats are found in some animal products and are not bad for you.\n  - Artificial trans fats are made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils, and these can be really bad for your health, according to the research I could find at the time of this video.\n    - Why is hydrogen added to these vegetable oils? Simply to keep them solid at room temperature in order to increase their shelf life.\n- Studies indicate that artificial trans fats increase inflammation, especially in people with excess weight or obesity.\\*\\*\\*\\*\n  - [[6]](https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1161/01.CIR.40.1S2.II-1)\n\n# 4. Vegetable oils\n\n- Lets dive deeper into the dangers of vegetable oils - [Canola, sunflower, corn oil]\n- Polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils can form toxic byproducts like aldehydes when exposed to heat or oxygen, leading to heart disease.\n- There‚Äôs a very long study, where a large group of people older than 60 were given either animal fats or vegetable oils. [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4176868/)\n  - People eating vegetable oils died significantly more than the people eating the animal fats. This happened despite the people in the animal fat group having twice as many heavy smokers.\n\n# 5. What about other fat types?\n\n- Fat can be split up into three categories: saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats\n- Since we just discussed saturated fats, let‚Äôs look at the healthiness of the other 2 fat types\n  - **Monounsaturated fats**\n    - Monounsaturated fats are said to be healthy overall,\n      - improving insulin sensitivity, [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11317662/)\n      - lowering blood pressure [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16287956/),\n      - and reducing cancer risk, specifically by taking olive oil [[10]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7927867/).\n  - **Polyunsaturated fats**\n    - Polyunsaturated fats are generally considered very healthy too, especially omega-3 fatty acids.\n    - Although omega-6 fats are essential as well, it‚Äôs recommended to not take them in excessive amounts, since that is found to cause inflammation in a 2018.\n      - Innes, J. K., & Calder, P. C. (2018). Omega-6 fatty acids and inflammation.¬†*Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids*,¬†*132*, 41-48. [11]\n\n### 5. A great source of these fats is animal foods\n\n- Meat contains a lot of vitamin b3, vitamin b12, zinc, and it‚Äôs a great source of protein as well.\n- Eggs are also amazing, containing an insane amount of nutrients, like choline, selenium, and vitamins.\n  - Fun fact: Almost all nutrients are stored in the yolk, while the egg white is mostly protein.\n- Fish - You probably already know fish is very healthy: Containing a lot of omega-3 fatty acids which are very healthy for the brain, and it‚Äôs generally been shown to low heart disease risk [[12]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22682084/)\n\n# 6. Takeaways\n\nIf you can reduce vegetable oils like canola oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil, and at the same time increase your usage of olive oil (preferably extra virgin), or simply butter or coconut oil, you are on a great trajectory to improve your health according to the current science i‚Äôve found regarding fats.

It gets really easy after some time, it becomes automatic\n2. You feel awake immediately\n3. Your body stays in great shape with minimal effort\n4. It gets me calm yet energized to get started on whatever I need to that day\n\n## The workout\n\nconsists of 13 exercises, each for 30 seconds. You can change\n\n- Duration\n- 5 seconds break\n\nyou can increase duration as you progress.\n\nyou can do it practically anywhere, any time. All you need is something resembling a chair for the tricep dipcs, and a wall for the wall sit.\n\nLet‚Äôs do the workout!\n\n1. Jumping Jacks\n2. Wall sit\n3. Push ups\n4. Sit ups\n5. Step on chair (or any other object)\n6. Squats\n7. Tricep dips\n8. Plank\n9. High knees\n10. Lunges\n11. Push ups with rotation\n12. Side plank right\n13. Side plank left\n\n## Measureable Results\n\nSimple way to stay fit, although I also run & do pullups\n\nThe first result that has to be part of the workouts is that I can simply do a lot of push-ups.\n\nNext, there is one general result from a study, that has shown what the 7M workout can do for anyone.\n\n> For the initial study, researchers had 29 people between the ages of 18 and 30 trial a 7-minute workout every day for six weeks. After six weeks, the study showed that the people had decreased in the waist and hip circumference, a lower fat mass, and a lower BMI. https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28085122/\n\nFor me, I went to the doctor's office at the National Sun Yat-Sen University campus, where I stepped on a scale that could measure my fat percentage.\nIt said 6.4%, but as I said earlier, this is most likely also due to running, and of course following a healthy diet. Now I‚Äôm at 5.3% according to the scale.\n\nSo download the app, and work out for yourself!\n\n_Link to the app:_ [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popularapp.sevenmins](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popularapp.sevenmins&hl=nl)\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\"\nsrc=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v2r_aXGAJWw\" \nframeborder=\"0\" \nallow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" \nallowfullscreen></iframe>\n",
  "2022-08-06-fasting.md": "---\ntitle: 'Why you should fast ‚Äî Fasting science'\ndate: 2022-08-06\npermalink: /posts/2022/08/fasting/\ntags:\n  - fasting\n  - health\n  - longevity\n---\n\nHi! I‚Äôm Elio and I will explain what fasting can do for you and how to apply it to your life.\n\nWe‚Äôll be looking into three topics:\n\n- What is fasting?\n- Why should you fast?\n- Some practical tips to implement fasting into your life\n\nWhat is fasting?\n-----\nFasting is not eating or taking in any calories for a certain number of hours. Water, tea, or coffee is fine, but avoid other drinks that contain calories.\n\n![fasting_clock](/images/fasting_clock.png)\n_Intermittent fasting ‚Äî The 18:6 protocol_\n\n**What happens during fasting?**\n![chart](/images/chart.png)\n_Visual approximation of glucose, glycogen and ketones percentage per hour_\n\nFirst, you will use up the sugar in your blood.\n\nThen, your body will start using stored glycogen in muscles to produce glucose.\n\nAfter this, your body will start burning fat to create glucose through a process called gluconeogenesis and to create ketones in the liver. Your body can then use these ketones as an alternative energy source.\n\nWhy should you fast?\n-----\nBecause fasting has LOTS of benefits. I will describe them by dividing these scientifically supported arguments in 4 categories: health & longevity, disease prevention & recovery, cognitive performance, and finally practical advantages.\n\n### Health & longevity\nImproves cardiovascular health based on 3 findings of the effects of fasting:\n\n- stronger left ventricle [pump blood body] [2]\n- improved flow-mediated vasodilation (how much arteries widen after flow restriction) [2]\nThis is an excellent predictor of long-term cardiovascular health\n- lower resting heartrate & blood pressure [2]\n\nFasting reduces insulin resistance [1]. This is the consequence of lower insulin in your body throughout the day.\n\n**Explanation**: insulin resistance is how well you can process glucose. Normally when you eat carbs, insulin is produced, allowing cells to take glucose and use it as fuel. When insulin resistance is present, this function is severely hampered, causing an overflow of sugar in your blood.\n\nFasting reduces inflammation [2].\n\nFasting stimulates production of growth hormone ‚Äî causing more growth, muscle strength, and an effective metabolism [2].\n\nFasting for about 3 days or more causes the production of certain proteins: mTOR, AMPK, and sirtuins [9].\n\nAMPK, mTOR and sirtuins allow for autophagy. Cells use their internal waste such as damaged proteins to produce useful stuff; they recycle parts of themselves.\n\nThese proteins can actually restore the epigenome.\n\nThe epigenome is the way in which the DNA is folded in each cell, defining the type and the characteristics of that cell. Over time, this epigenome can get damaged by environmental factors. I have not been able to find out how this happens exactly, as it‚Äôs a quite complex process.\n\nBurning fat [1] and reducing blood glucose are other consequences of fasting [2]. As you burn fat, your body can more easily burn fat in the future, you become what‚Äôs called ‚Äòfat-adapted‚Äô.\n\nFasting lowers LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol [2].\n\n### Disease prevention and recovery\nNext to all these health benefits, fasting also reduces the likelihood of a LOT of common diseases:\nAlzheimer‚Äôs disease, cancer, diabetes, parkinson‚Äôs disease, respiratory diseases, therosclerosis, cardiomyopathies, and renal diseases [2].\n\n### Cognitive performance\nIncrease in neurotrophic factors (FNF and BDNF) leads to neurogenesis, more brain cell generation! This, in turn, causes better memory & brain function [2].\n\n#### Steady energy [2]\nThis is not necessarily experienced during fasting, especially when your body is not yet well adapted to using ketones as fuel, but after fasting your energy levels will be more steady due to the increased stability of glucose levels.\n\nThis stability is a consequence of the increased insulin sensitivity, where your body gets rid of excess glucose more easily, leaving you with higher glucose dips.\n\n### Practical advantages\nFree time for other things, no more breaks just to eat.\n\nLosing weight by burning fat.\n\n**Potential benefits:**\n\n- Happiness ‚Äî supported by Ramadan fasting [10]. This effect could also have been the consequence of the increased social connection or any other part of ramadan fasting that is not fasting itself.\nHowever, I can say that fasting definitely contributed to my own happiness, where some days where I‚Äôm fasting I feel simply incredible.\nOf course, this could also be due to other factors, but I feel like fasting certainly plays a role.\n- Decrease in stress ‚Äî lower anxiety & depression levels [8].\n\n### Why shouldn‚Äôt you fast?\nFasting can cause fatigue, headaches, nausea, and cravings [11, 12].\n\nThese problems should disappear with time, but by easing yourself into fasting, you can make the transition more pleasant.\n\nFasting causes decreased athletic performance, especially for anaerobic exercise.\n\nPractical tips\n-----\nUse apps that keep track of your fasting session.\n\n- Fasting tracker (also has a water tracker)\n- Zero (Lots of useful info at their blog. They also have a quiz that makes you reflect on your choices!)\n\nDrink enough water & take minerals: 2‚Äì4g salt/day or about a teaspoon per day [4], 400‚Äì600mg magnesium/day [3], and 2‚Äì5g potassium/ day [13]. This is especially important for extended, multiple day fasts.\n\nSalt is essential for controlling the water levels in cells, passing on nerve signals and maintaining an acid-base balance. If salt levels become too low, this can even become dangerous!\n\nAs your body has less salt, the osmolarity outside of your cells drops. This causes the water to move from this extracellular space into your cells, making them swell and eventually burst or die. If you feel tired, nauseous, or generally bad, you may have not had enough salt.\n\nWhen going longer than 5 days, I recommend to seek special advice for what supplements you might need.\n\nStart easy by fasting just a bit longer than you normally fast each day. From there, slowly work your way up towards longer intermittent fasting when you feel ready. For example, start with 16 hours/day, and slowly work your way up to 20 hours/day.\n\nOnce your body has been accomodated to using fat as fuel through intermittent fasting, you can try fasting for multiple days, as this is where the greater benefits of fasting like autophagy come into play.\n\nAlso find what works for you ‚Äî how can you easily incomporate fasting into your schedule?\n\nGood luck!\n\n### References\n[1] (Yongin Cho et al., 2019)\n\n[2] (Ahmed et al., 2018)\n\n[3] Why You Need Magnesium on a Fast ‚Äî Zero\n\n[4] Why You Need Sodium on a Fast ‚Äî Zero\n\n[5] Cho, Y., et al. 2019\n\n[6] Anton et al., 2018\n\n[7] Bergendahl te al., 1996\n\n[8] Campante, F., & Yanagizawa-Drott, D.
