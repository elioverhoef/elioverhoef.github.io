As someone who is passionate about optimizing my health and productivity, I have developed a morning routine that sets me up for success throughout the day. In this blog post, I will share the key elements of my routine and explain how each component contributes to my overall well-being.

## Making the Bed and Taking Supplements

I always start my day by making my bed, as it helps me feel a sense of accomplishment and sets a positive tone for the day ahead. After that, I take several supplements, including omega-3 fatty acids, probiotics, and vitamin D. I also drink a significant amount of water with some salt to ensure proper hydration after a night of sleep.

## Full Body Workout and Artificial Sunlight

Before going for a run, I perform a full-body workout called the "7-Minute Workout." This workout consists of 13 exercises, each performed for 30 seconds:

1. Jumping jacks
2. Wall sit
3. Push-ups
4. Crunches
5. Step-ups onto a chair
6. Squats
7. Tricep dips on a chair
8. Plank
9. High knees
10. Lunges
11. Push-ups with rotation
12. Side plank (right)
13. Side plank (left)

During the workout, I turn on my 10,000 lux light to simulate morning sunlight, especially during the winter months when natural sunlight is limited.

## Running and Journaling

After brushing my teeth and doing some journaling, I put on my running shoes and do a brief warm-up. Then, I start my run as programmed into my Coros running watch. Running is an excellent way to improve cardiovascular health and boost mental clarity.

## Breakfast and Intermittent Fasting

Following my run, I have my breakfast, which is essentially my entire day's worth of food. I practice intermittent fasting, meaning I only eat in the morning and do not have lunch or dinner. My breakfast consists of three main components:

1. **4 eggs with spices and salt:** Eggs are a great source of protein and essential nutrients.
2. **Skyr with various toppings:** I combine about 200 grams of skyr (a type of Icelandic yogurt) with 30 grams each of blueberries and raspberries, 15 grams of pumpkin seeds (a good source of magnesium), cacao nibs, 40 grams of a nut mix (containing walnuts, hazelnuts, macadamia nuts, etc.), 30 grams of peanut butter, and 5 grams of creatine. Creatine has been shown to support mental function.
3. **A third meal that varies daily:** This often includes minced meat with vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli.

## Conclusion

By consistently following this optimized morning routine, I have found that I am better prepared to tackle the challenges of the day. The combination of supplements, exercise, journaling, and a nutritious breakfast provides me with the physical and mental energy I need to perform at my best. While everyone's ideal routine may differ, I encourage you to experiment and find what works best for you in terms of promoting health and productivity.
