### Why do some people consider fat to be a bad thing?

In the 1960’s, sugar companies paid to spread the message that fat was to blame for people’s health problems, while promoting sugar [[1]](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat).

This propaganda, initiated in the United States, later spread through word of mouth, still causing discussions today!

I have done, and will do some more research on what is actually going on.

Two things before we get started.

1. I might be wrong
2. There are contradicting studies out there since studies can be performed incorrectly, or with a small sample size.
   What I think I know now might not be the truth, as biology is complicated and researchers can have biases and hidden agendas.

# 1. People with a fat-based diet live **longer**

Let’s start with the broad picture.

A longitudal study from 2017 found that high carbohydrate intake was associated with a higher risk of mortality, while high fat intake was associated with a lower risk of mortality. Participants with the highest carbohydrate intake (77% of calories) were 28% more likely to have died, while those with the highest fat intake (35% of calories) were 23% less likely to have died. Higher saturated fat intake was also associated with a lower riswk of strokes.

- Dehghan, M., Mente, A., Zhang, X., Swaminathan, S., Li, W., Mohan, V., ... & Garcia, R. (2017). Associations of fats and carbohydrate intake with cardiovascular disease and mortality in 18 countries from five continents (PURE): a prospective cohort study. *The Lancet*, *390*(10107), 2050-2062. [2]
- A study from the Journal of Alzheimer found that [people whose diets were highest in fat — compared to the lowest — were 42 percent less likely to face cognitive impairment](https://www.j-alz.com/content/eating-lots-carbs-sugar-may-raise-risk-cognitive-impairment-mayo-clinic-study-finds).
- I have been following eating relatively high fat for my time in Taiwan, and feel great.

# 2. What about saturated fat? Is that healthy?

- According to the American Heart Association **today**, it is NOT, since it increases LDL “bad” cholesterol. [[3]](https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats#:~:text=AHA%20Recommendation,of%20saturated%20fat%20per%20day).
- But is LDL cholesterol actually bad?
- A study of 136,000 patients admitted to the hospital for a coronary artery event found that nearly 50% of them had a low **LDL cholesterol** level, despite the common belief that high LDL cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. [[4]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211335519300592?via%3Dihub)
- **A recent meta analysis, which is basically a study of lots of different studies, found that higher LDL cholesterol was associated with greater longevity & thus lower mortality! The analysis was performed on 19 studies, with a total patient count of 6 million.** [[5]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347488140_The_LDL_Paradox_Higher_LDL-Cholesterol_is_Associated_with_Greater_Longevity_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution_40_International_License)

# 3. What about trans fats?

- Trans fats come in two types: natural and artificial.
  - Natural trans fats are found in some animal products and are not bad for you.
  - Artificial trans fats are made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oils, and these can be really bad for your health, according to the research I could find at the time of this video.
    - Why is hydrogen added to these vegetable oils? Simply to keep them solid at room temperature in order to increase their shelf life.
- Studies indicate that artificial trans fats increase inflammation, especially in people with excess weight or obesity.\*\*\*\*

# 4. Vegetable oils

- Lets dive deeper into the dangers of vegetable oils - [Canola, sunflower, corn oil]
- Polyunsaturated fatty acids in vegetable oils can form toxic byproducts like aldehydes when exposed to heat or oxygen, leading to heart disease.
- There’s a very long study, where a large group of people older than 60 were given either animal fats or vegetable oils. [[7]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4176868/)
  - People eating vegetable oils died significantly more than the people eating the animal fats. This happened despite the people in the animal fat group having twice as many heavy smokers.

# 5. What about other fat types?

- Fat can be split up into three categories: saturated fats, monounsaturated fats, and polyunsaturated fats
- Since we just discussed saturated fats, let’s look at the healthiness of the other 2 fat types
  - **Monounsaturated fats**
    - Monounsaturated fats are said to be healthy overall,
      - improving insulin sensitivity, [[8]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11317662/)
      - lowering blood pressure [[9]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16287956/),
      - and reducing cancer risk, specifically by taking olive oil [[10]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7927867/).
  - **Polyunsaturated fats**
    - Polyunsaturated fats are generally considered very healthy too, especially omega-3 fatty acids.
    - Although omega-6 fats are essential as well, it’s recommended to not take them in excessive amounts, since that is found to cause inflammation in a 2018.
      - Innes, J. K., & Calder, P. C. (2018). Omega-6 fatty acids and inflammation. *Prostaglandins, Leukotrienes and Essential Fatty Acids*, *132*, 41-48. [11]

### 5. A great source of these fats is animal foods

- Meat contains a lot of vitamin b3, vitamin b12, zinc, and it’s a great source of protein as well.
- Eggs are also amazing, containing an insane amount of nutrients, like choline, selenium, and vitamins.
  - Fun fact: Almost all nutrients are stored in the yolk, while the egg white is mostly protein.
- Fish - You probably already know fish is very healthy: Containing a lot of omega-3 fatty acids which are very healthy for the brain, and it’s generally been shown to low heart disease risk [[12]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22682084/)

# 6. Takeaways

If you can reduce vegetable oils like canola oil, sunflower oil, and rapeseed oil, and at the same time increase your usage of olive oil (preferably extra virgin), or simply butter or coconut oil, you are on a great trajectory to improve your health according to the current science i’ve found regarding fats. [[13]](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29511019/), [[14]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24886626)

If you think I missed something or made a mistake in my discussion of fats, please let me know and I will make sure to look into it!
