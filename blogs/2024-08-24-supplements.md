Hi, I'm Elio, and I take 91 supplements per week, or 13 different supplements every day. I do this to live in optimal health, with optimal energy levels, and to live to be a very old man. Some supplements are focused on improving my sleep, some for keeping the levels of vitamins or fatty acids in check, and others to improve my energy levels and cognitive function.

It's important to note that supplements should be an addition to a good diet. People should research what supplements they need. I've done some research into the supplements that I believe are right for me. I've adjusted what I take based on how I react to them, so this is not something you should just blindly copy. Basically, do your own research.

I did a lot of research on what supplements other people take, why they take them, what the science says about supplements, and I have done two blood tests to find out if I'm lacking anything. That is what I've based my supplement stack on.

Let's get into the supplements!

      - May improve cognitive symptoms in older adults with mild to moderate dementia
      - Potentially enhances athletic performance, particularly in power output and vertical jump power
      - Increases acetylcholine in the brain for increased cognitive performance and focus
    - **Considerations**:

      - More research is needed to confirm long-term effects and safety, also regarding strokes
      - Not needed if you consume 5+ eggs daily

## Supplement Timing

I take everything in the morning except for my sleep supplements.
In the afteroon, I take Pure Brainpower, Alpha-GPC (300mg or 600mg, not always, for focus), and 1 of the 3 pills of Omega-3 (other 2 in the morning).

## Conclusion

So, these are all my supplements. I highly encourage you to research these and other supplements yourself to improve your own health and well-being.

Examine.com is a great website for performing this research, providing the benefits and a general summary for basically every researched supplement. It also shows the studies from which the info is taken.

I recommend omega-3, vitamin D, and the sleep stack for most people. These supplements can do no harm when taken appropriately. Omega-3 and vitamin D are often lacking in people who don't eat fish daily or spend most of the day in the sun.

Thank you for reading! I'm always interested in hearing about others' experiences with supplements. What works for you? What doesn't? Let's start a discussion in the comments below.
